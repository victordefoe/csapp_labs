### This is my study space of CSAPP

CSAPP, as known dubbed form book (also a course) "Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective", 
gives a lot of help while I look back to the fundamental knowledge of CS. 
Now it's the chance to dig in some valuable information and do the labs assignment it provides, 
which is also beneficial for coding skills.

Because of the stuff IRL, this progress will be really slow, 
so it would be more like a little entertainment for myself. 
After it finishes someday (in the future), someone might probably take it as a coursework reference.

If any chance, I would also write some notes(or annotations) alongside. 

## UPDATE Timeline
